# Day 2 Options

ðŸ’¡ Here are some ideas to choose from:

- _Auto-Greeter_ - A form that asks for your name and, after it has been submitted, adds text to the screen that says: "Hello, (your name here)"
- _To-do list_ - An app where you can add items to the to-do list by typing them in and clicking a submit button.
- _Pet Namer_ - You are presented with different pets that the user can then name using a text input field. You can find pet image URLs in the `pet-namer.js` file in the `assets` folder.
- _Names-in-a-hat generator_ - You add names one at a time via a text input to a list of names, and then have the option to pick a random name from the list.
