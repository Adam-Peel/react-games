# Hangman Game App:

This repo is a testing-ground for the development of a simple hangman-style games app, using React.js.

The app is currently in the state of being a minimum viable product with the following features:

1. A difficulty setting which alters the number of available guesses
2. A random word retrieval with an associated definition to act as a hint
3. The ability to guess by individual letter, or by word
4. A session 'score' tracking system for games played, and scores provided for games won which are weighted differently according to the difficulty.
5. A simple 'about' page with instructions for gameplay and descriptions of scoring
