# Hangman Game App:

This repo is a testing-ground for the development of a simple hangman-style games app, using React.js.

As a testing-ground the app is still in development with the following features planned to be added:

- Retrieving words from an api
- Adding difficulty settings to increase word length and change the guess counts
- Implementing a 'hint' feature by retrieving a dictionary definition for each word
- Adding a tracker to keep track of 'low-scores' per session
- Developing a more refined graphic for the hangman
