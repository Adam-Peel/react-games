# Day 1 Options

ðŸ’¡ Here are some ideas to choose from:

- _Dog-Hat-O-matic_ - Use a button to switch between a picture of a dog with and without a hat on. We've included some images in the `assets` folder!
- _Random **\_\_\_** generator_ - Replicate a 'random name generator' or 'random D&D character generator'. You will need to hard code your data.
- _Image Gallery_ - Have an array of image urls (you can use [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for free images or provide your own!) and make an image gallery with buttons for displaying the next image.
- _Dice Roller_ - A dice roller where pressing a button randomly generates a single dice roll.
- _Travel locations_ - Render a list of locations that people can visit and tick off once they've been there. Users can click on one to change it to visited and change the styling accordingly.
- _Shopping list_ - Provide the user with a list of clickable, available items to buy. When you click an item, you add it to your shopping list. Users can then remove the item from the list by clicking on it again.
- _Fortune teller_ - You randomly select from a group of ten fortunes when the user clicks a button. If you can't think of any fortunes, check the `fortunes.js` file in the `assets` folder.
